##Game##

Important notice!
This is intended for the miniatures game "Frostgrave" and in no way replaces the need for use of the main rule book.
All information in this game system is for those who have fully read and understood the rules.

##Instructions to get started##

First select the game system file "Frostgrave", then select "Add Force", make sure force type say "Warband" and the catalogue is "Frostgrave" then press ok.
To add the "Vault" select frostgrave warband and add another force this time the force type will say "The Vault", click add. Do not add a points total it is not needed)

##Warband##

This is where you create your warband. First select a wizard to start the warband (on selection 500 points/ Gc will be addded to the points total).
Buying or hiring will deduct the cost from the points. if during a game a soldier is killed then first select the appropriate soldier from " Dead or Dismissed"
and increase the selection by 1 (this may relate to any cost modifiers currently in play). Once added remove the soldier from the list, now the points cost has been adjusted correctly.
