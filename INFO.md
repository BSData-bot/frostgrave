THE VAULT
This is you stock keep for the game. everything you earn after a game will be stored here.

PROCESS
The process of the 2 lists is a follows
1- Update and store you Vault list
2- Create your warband adding any items that IS avalible from the list though.
3-Play the game and tally up you treasure
4-Before adding anything remove all the item that were used in the previouse game.

The list supports full leveling of the wizard and also works the apprentice off the wizard stas with no manual changing. All spells are added,
 also appends the base casting number in reference to weather the wizards school of magic is alligned, neutral or opposed to it.
